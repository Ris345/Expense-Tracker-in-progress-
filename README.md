## Summary

  This is a handy expense tracker, user can enter expenses with date, payment-method and the amount. User can also delete expenses at any given time. This was my first react project, I really enjoyed working through this -- I have a better understanding of states and props after completing this project. I also have a better understanding of passing data from parent --> child and child --> parent in react.
